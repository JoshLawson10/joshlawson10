## Hey, I'm Josh ðŸ‘‹

I like mixing code with design until something useful (and hopefully beautiful) comes out.  

Right now, Iâ€™m pouring way too much energy into **[TermUI](https://github.com/JoshLawson10/termui)** â€” a modern Python library for building clean, themeable terminal UIs.  

When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me drumming.
