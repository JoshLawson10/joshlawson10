## Hey, I'm Josh ðŸ‘‹

I like mixing code with design until something useful (and hopefully beautiful) comes out.  

Right now, Iâ€™m pouring way too much energy into **[TermUI](https://github.com/JoshLawson10/termui)** â€” a modern Python library for building clean, themeable terminal UIs.  

When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me drumming or experimenting in the kitchen.

## What I'm Working On ðŸš€
- **[TermUI](https://github.com/JoshLawson10/termui)** â€” A theme-first Python UI library for the terminal (because console apps deserve to look good).

## About Me
- I like building **developer tools** that balance simplicity and flexibility.  
- I believe **good design makes code more enjoyable**.  
- I spend more time breaking things than I probably should...
